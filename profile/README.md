# PatternFly Java

[PatternFly Java](https://github.com/patternfly-java/patternfly-java?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) is a ðŸ’¯ Java implementation of [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org/) without any JavaScript dependencies. Its goal is to provide an easy-to-use, elegant, and efficient API to build complex web applications with PatternFly in Java. PatternFly Java integrates with and builds upon Elemento's [builder API](https://github.com/hal/elemento#builder-api). It works with both GWT and J2CL. 

PatternFly Java aims to provide almost complete support for all components, charts, extensions, and layouts. To see it in action, head over to the [showcase](https://patternfly-java.github.io/). It demonstrates all currently supported components and layouts. To get all the details about using PatternFly Java, look at the [API documentation](https://patternfly-java.github.io/apidocs/).
