# PatternFly Java

PatternFly Java is a Java implementation of [PatternFly 5]([url](https://www.patternfly.org/)). Its goal is to provide an easy-to-use, elegant, and efficient API to build complex web applications with PatternFly in Java. PatternFly Java integrates with and builds upon Elemento's [builder API]([url](https://github.com/hal/elemento#builder-api)). It works with both GWT and J2CL.
